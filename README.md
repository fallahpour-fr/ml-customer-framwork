# framework for classification and regression dataset

Create a framework with below specifications:


* pre-processing method: this method can change by dataset.
* use Adaboost, XGBoost, SVM, Random forest, and LDA to classification
* use SVR, GBR, Adaboost regressor, Random forest regressor, LR to regression problem.
* make methods to show box plot, scatter plot, and barplot. (each plot has a method). Plots can show differences between models and differences between different modes of the same model
* for classification problems use confusion matrix and classification report.
